# Number Guesser
- The game begins by selecting a number. The range is from 1 to 100.
- The player then starts making guesses, after each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- The player continues to make guesses, using the feedback to narrow down their choices until they eventually guess the correct number.
- The game may keep track of the number of attempts the player has made and display this information, allowing the player to challenge themselves to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.

# Rock Paper Scissors
- Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand gesture game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors in a bid to outsmart their opponent.
- Players take turns choosing one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
- The winner is determined based on a simple set of rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
- The game typically consists of a series of rounds, and the player with the most wins at the end is declared the overall winner.

# Hangman
- Guessing Letters: The players who are trying to guess the word take turns suggesting letters of the alphabet. If the guessed letter is in the secret word, it is filled into the appropriate blank spaces.
- If the letter is not in the word, the letter is placed in the guessed letter list and you are given a warning of how many attempts you have left. you start with 6.
- Winning and Losing: The guessing players continue to suggest letters until they either guess the entire word correctly or make too many incorrect guesses, resulting in no more attempts. If they guess the word before the lose their attempts, they win.
